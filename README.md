# Project Report

**1. Resume**

This project is a ski simulator that can calculate work and energy. This project allows a user to input a mass data and to control the trajectory of the slope for the ball to follow. The user has a minium and maximum of 7 short lines to put in order to create the path. The projet has sliders which allows a user to control the length and angle of the jump so that the ball can do a projectile motion trajectory. Once everything is ready you can click on start in order to start the animation of the ball going down the slope, you can pause it during the animation. Once the animation finishes, a result box pops up and shows the result of velocity x and y of the ball and the work energy that the ball went through.

This project was separated between Le Nguyen Tan Alex and Ye Yint Zin. Ye Yint contributed to the first model of the application FXML file. He created the main methods for that path creation and the ball following that path like the projectile motion. Ye Yint also did the calculation methods in order to get the result box shown. Alex Le did a lot bug fixing, and added more features for the application FXML file. He created a method that creates slope when the path is finished and the click button started. He did the Junit testing and the welcome screen. He also changed the CSS styles of the programs and changed the UI.
